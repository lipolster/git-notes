# Git branches
Definition of Git branches:

The default name for the original branch is "Master", which points to the commits you make all while keeping your repository the same. Branching is useful when working in a team because each team member completing seperate tasks can make their own branches. Each branch remains seperate and will not affect other branches unless the user calls for it.
